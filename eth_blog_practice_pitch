  ETHERUM TOKENS BLOG

Hi my name is Ernesto

Towards the end of business school i decided i wanted to do
a programming bootcamp because software technology was really fun and interesting for me .
when i finished school I took an online complete python
bootcamp using jupyter notebooks but I was still lacking some basic technologies
so I decided to take a presential bootcamp. After some research and looking at different options
I decided to come to Launch and learn rails , and react to become a full stack developer



My personal project (breakeble toy) is a etherum blog
  A blog that has all the prices for the etherum tokens.
  You can see and review all the tokens available in the etherum network , comment on them and leave reviews
  ass well as sharing information in the main index page.
  Have access to the main web dAPPS for decentralize exchange and other useful content

And Im exited to joinn a team and contibute right away and start learning new technologies
